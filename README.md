- You dont really need a video driver for your Paradise PVGA1 (?) because these Toshiba models do have - although indeed having one of the first Paradise SVGA compatible chipsets - only 256kb of video RAM, iirc. which means youre limited to a max of 640x480x16 at max, if I am not mistaken. I have tried installing various drivers for the exact same chipset on my T3200SX without success before realizing that it only has 256kb video RAM. 

 
Just noticed: T3200 or T3200SX? T3200 has EGA graphics card and suitable EGA plasma screen (4 levels of intensity) - same as T5100, except in larger form factor. T3200SX on the other hand has VGA screen (16 levels of intensity) that can be swapped with T5200. 

T5200 and T3200SX do have the same displays, VGA 640x480, 16 shades of intensity. T3200 and T5100 have EGA screens of similar size, but different parameters: 640 by 400 pixels and 4 shades of intensity - that's why CGA games look really well on these machines. 

### Issues 
there is a single line vertical artifact on screen.  

Quite often in these screens this may be a "cold solder" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering#Electronics ). You can try to check these "fat" solders on top of the screen - every now and then one of them can be repaired.
