- Lid is different:




- LCD display is smaller than the plasma (10.4" vs 11.5")

### Components

PC001, PC002: 0N3105


# BIOS

### BIOS entry

- Hold down Esc while powering on the system to force an error, then hit F1
- Alternatively, launch TEST3.EXE from MS-DOS


### BIOS chip

- Chip could be from AMD or Texas Instruments

###  CMOS Battery

- I replaced mine with a 3V CR2032 battery (with battery holder) and diode (if you're worried about the machine trying to "charge" the battery).

# Memory (RAM)

- 1MB of RAM is soldered on the RAM board - the system will run just fine with no SIMMs
- 6x 40-pin SIMM slots (proprietary) SIMM slots and 1x 30-pin parity slot (optional)
- A maximum of 16MB is supported (but I've only seen up to 14MB).
- RAM types appear to be the same as the Toshiba T8500 desktop PC and Acer 735C.

### SIMMs

Front and back of 4 different modules:

## RAM Mod

 Here are details on a mod to add 8MB of RAM using a standard 72 pin 8MB Parity SIMM. (Requires at least 2MB of proprietary SIMMs already fitted) 

 Use this info at your own risk, don't blame me if you damage your T5200!

You might be able to use a 16 bit ISA memory expansion board for memory below 16MB but that might not work and would be very slow even if it did. 

Each pair of SIMM slots has a single label on the component side so there are 6 slots but only 3 labels (IS17, IS16 & IS15 - ignoring the short 30 pin slot). The middle pair is IS16 and one slot I have referenced as "A" and the other as "B" although they are not labelled

# Motherboard/Mainboard

# CPU

- 132-pin PGA i386 @ 20MHz

## CPU Upgrades

you can fit a 33Mhz or 40Mhz upgrade CPU in the T5200, it will just run at 20Mhz unless the CPU has built in clock doubling. The hardware mods improve the performance of some of the upgrade CPUs but aren't essential and the CPUs will work if you plug them in without any mods albeit with reduced performance. 

 There are four possible 486 compatible CPUs from Cyrix / Texas instruments that can be used to upgrade the T5200s Intel 386 processor (Texas Instruments made the CPUs for Cyrix and sold them under their own brand as well): 

 Be careful when installing, do not confuse PIN 1!!! 
 
- Texas Instruments TXI486DLC/E-33GA
- Texas Instruments TX486DLC-40BGA

# Math Co-Processor

- Standard i387 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/138083051-54b49b0b-7ac3-44ec-b2b5-11dccef7f51e.png)


# Hard Disk (HDD)

- BIOS only supports 3 types of Conner drives, available in 40MB, 100MB and 200MB (rarer) capacities

- Replacement drive must match one of the 3 approved conner HDDs - it must match the CHS setting in the BIOS and its model number must start with CP (Conner Peripherals).
 

### Conner CP-344/CP-3044 (40MB)

## HDD upgrades/mods

### XT-IDE option

- An ISA card with IDE connector/SD card slot/CF card slot

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/160276380-2011e3bd-5cda-4115-9b6d-9a595bb18bc0.png)

https://conventionalmemories.com/wiki_cm/3inONEder_for_Toshiba_portables

https://texelec.com/product/lo-tech-xt-cf-lite-rev-2/

- Set the IO_ADDR to 300H
- Prepare a CF card (install MS-DOS in VirtualBox, convert the VDI to .IMG, use Win32DiskImager to write to the CF card



Options:
- fire up the T5200 and go in to the BIOS setup and see what hard drive options you have - write them down - and buy a matching Conner CP series IDE drive.
- write the AT version of XTIDE to a boot ROM and configure it in a network card, set the T5200 to no hard drive, and install any generic IDE hard drive.
- find another Conner IDE drive and ask someone on here to hack the ROM, then burn the new ROM and replace the one on your motherboard (or maybe get away with drive overlay software)

 Drive Overlay software is a program that sits in the boot sector and reconfigures the drive before DOS starts.
 

# Floppy Disk (FDD)

- 26-pin (non-standard) FDD connector, which carries data + power. 
- These drives are prone to failure, and rarely work anymore
- â„¹Recommend the floppy drive mod below which involves hacking a ribbon cable to allow a standard 34-pin floppy (or Gotek USB floppy emulator) to work

- Adapters like this may also work:

# Display

### Specs

- Orange Gas Plasma Display (T5200, T5200/100, T5200/200) Display Area: 9.1"W x 6.8"H; 11.5"  

- diagonal Resolution: 640 x 480 

- Gray scales: 16 Contrast: 100 : 1 

- 34 pin plug 

- T5200 and T3200SX have the same displays, VGA 640x480, 16 shades of intensity. 

### VGA / Video Card / HRGS

- Board: FH3HR4 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38451588/138082616-0a46b4bf-1432-4946-92b2-cd6db4440687.png)


- Capacitors C2 and C4 are 16v 47uF and do not appear to be related to the plasma display
- C2 does not appear to be related to the plasma display (maybe it's for the VGA port?)
- R127 and R134 (SMD resistors on rear) do not appear to be related to the plasma display

- "You dont really need a video driver for your Paradise PVGA1 (?) because these Toshiba models do have - although indeed having one of the first Paradise SVGA compatible chipsets - only 256kb of video RAM, iirc. which means youre limited to a max of 640x480x16 at max, if I am not mistaken."




## I/O card

- Note - system will not POST without this card present.

# Combination Lock

# Fans / Cooling

- 3x 4cm x 2cm 12v dumb fans

# ISA slots
 - One 16-bit (top)
 - One 8-bit (bottom)

# Rear Expansion Slot

- Often unpopulated, but modems were the most common expansion. I've also seen parallel ports.

Connector made by KEL and 3m makes compatible connectors as well. Part numbers: KEL 8801-060-170L-F or 3M P50-060S-RR1-EA

### Issues 
there is a single line vertical artifact on screen.  

Quite often in these screens this may be a "cold solder" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering#Electronics ). You can try to check these "fat" solders on top of the screen - every now and then one of them can be repaired. 


# Photos
